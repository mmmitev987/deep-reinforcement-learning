# Deep Reinforcement Learning

This project implements and explains the full training pipeline of a Deep Reinforcement Learning agent using **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)** with **Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE)**.

All core concepts are not only used in the implementation, but also **fully explained theoretically and practically inside the project**, for the subject Artificial Intelligence
